## Problem Statement
Many weightlifting tracking apps are paid for or include advertisements. I have a structured workout that I follow that doesn't require all the features of a paid app, but I often forget what I did last time and it's a pain to calculate what weights to be lifting in each session.

## Solution
The Weightlifting Tracker will be used to be able to record the result of workouts and retrieve the next workout I'm due to do.
